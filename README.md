# H-Bond written by Sudheer Kumar Peddathimmareddy

The purpose of the code is to calculate total number of H-Bonds:
  1.  Per water molecule.
  2.  Per frame, if a trajectory is provided.

NOTE: angle.py, angle_sort.py, distance.py and hbonds.py are modules used in the programs H-Bond_single_frame.py and Donated-accepted_single_frame.py

"H-Bonds_single_frame.py" provides information about number of H-bonds per molecule for a single frame of the trajectory whereas "Donated-accepted_single_frame.py" provides additional information like how many of those bonds are donated type or accepted type.
